In this modification, the cybercriminals have added new functionality: it now also works as a keylogger, stealing entered text through the use of accessibility services.\r\n\r\nAccessibility services generally provide user interface (UI) enhancements for users with disabilities or those temporarily unable to interact fully with a device, perhaps because they are driving. Abusing this system feature allows the Trojan not only to steal entered text from other apps installed on the device, but also to grant itself more permissions and rights, and to counteract attempts to uninstall the Trojan.\r\n\r\nAttack data suggests this Trojan is not yet widely deployed. In the space of a week, we observed only a small number of users attacked, but these targets spanned 23 countries. Most attacked users were in Russia (29%), Germany (27%), Turkey (15%), Poland (6%) and France (3%). It is worth noting that, even though most attacked users are from Russia, this Trojan won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work on devices running the Russian language. This is a standard tactic for Russian cybercriminals looking to evade detection and arrest.\r\n\r\nThe Svpeng malware family is known for being innovative. Starting from 2013, it was among the first to begin attacking SMS banking, to use phishing pages to overlay other apps to steal credentials, and to block devices and demand money. In 2016, cybercriminals were actively distributing Svpeng through AdSense using a vulnerability in the Chrome browser. This makes Svpeng one of the most dangerous mobile malware families, and it is why we monitor the functionality of new versions.", "uuid": "598012ae-e154-4183-ab6a-4c7202de0b81", "timestamp": "1501565723", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "", "category": "External analysis", "type": "text", "Tag": [{"colour": "#00223b", "name": "osint:source-type=\"blog-post\""}]}, {"to_ids": true, "deleted": false, "value": "f536bc5b79c16e9a84546c2049e810e1", "uuid": "598012cd-6988-42ec-85da-4dc702de0b81", "timestamp": "1501565723", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "The Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng.ae is distributed from malicious websites as a fake flash player.
