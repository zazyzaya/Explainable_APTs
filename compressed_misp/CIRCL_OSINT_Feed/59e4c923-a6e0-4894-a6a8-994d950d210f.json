As soon as we find new vulnerabilities we immediately inform the vendor in a responsible manner and provide all the details required for a fix.\r\n\r\nOn October 10, 2017, Kaspersky Lab\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced exploit prevention systems identified a new Adobe Flash zero day exploit used in the wild against our customers. The exploit was delivered through a Microsoft Office document and the final payload was the latest version of FinSpy malware. We have reported the bug to Adobe who assigned it CVE-2017-11292 and released a patch earlier today:\r\n\r\nSo far only one attack has been observed in our customer base, leading us to believe the number of attacks are minimal and highly targeted.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the payload allowed us to confidently link this attack to an actor we track as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153BlackOasis\u00e2\u20ac\u009d. We are also highly confident that BlackOasis was also responsible for another zero day exploit (CVE-2017-8759) discovered by FireEye in September 2017.
