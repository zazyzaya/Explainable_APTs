Even more, this malware works on any 32-bit Microsoft Windows system (many POS systems on the market today are still running on Microsoft Windows XP) allowing to use this malware on more than just POS systems.\r\n\r\nBy leveraging process snapshots extracted by the Lastline FUSE sandbox, we walk through the most important parts of this versatile framework. We will show in detail how the infection spreads through the entire operating system, and how the attackers behind ModPOS can leverage the framework to load arbitrary plugins into user- and kernel-space of an infected system.", "uuid": "57098301-f488-4ac6-8806-297802de0b81", "timestamp": "1460241153", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "", "category": "External analysis", "type": "comment"}, {"to_ids": true, "deleted": false, "value": "130.0.237.22", "uuid": "57098322-d684-4142-82d1-39e802de0b81", "timestamp": "1460241186", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "The variant that we analyzed for this blog uses an HTTP POST for requesting the page \"/robots.txt\" on the following IPs", "category": "Network activity", "type": "ip-dst"}, {"to_ids": true, "deleted": false, "value": "109.72.149.42", "uuid": "57098323-6168-4d41-b312-39e802de0b81", "timestamp": "1460241187", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "The variant that we analyzed for this blog uses an HTTP POST for requesting the page \"/robots.txt\" on the following IPs", "category": "Network activity", "type": "ip-dst"}, {"to_ids": true, "deleted": false, "value": "cf446e1d423afb9933b211d28d3ea33a", "uuid": "570983c8-5140-4be6-b915-297e02de0b81", "timestamp": "1460241352", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "", "category": "Payload installation", "type": "md5"}, {"to_ids": true, "deleted": false, "value": "2aa35ae062f83248585b924dd668ed0a1a3089550a772900789b0feba1a923bb", "uuid": "570983e1-5af0-45b0-97dc-39e902de0b81", "timestamp": "1460241377", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "- Xchecked via VT: cf446e1d423afb9933b211d28d3ea33a", "category": "Payload installation", "type": "sha256"}, {"to_ids": true, "deleted": false, "value": "36951f140723ef6a51bdff5d6da4eca8734bf24c", "uuid": "570983e1-9308-4e15-8828-39e902de0b81", "timestamp": "1460241377", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "- Xchecked via VT: cf446e1d423afb9933b211d28d3ea33a", "category": "Payload installation", "type": "sha1"}, {"to_ids": false, "deleted": false, "value": "https://www.virustotal.com/file/2aa35ae062f83248585b924dd668ed0a1a3089550a772900789b0feba1a923bb/analysis/1449594049/", "uuid": "570983e2-3f88-44a0-8df6-39e902de0b81", "timestamp": "1460241378", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "", "category": "External analysis", "type": "link"}]}}
