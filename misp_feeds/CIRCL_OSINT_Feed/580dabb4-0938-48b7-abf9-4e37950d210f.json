We discovered a new variant of a Brazilian-made ransomware, Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Xpan, that is being used to infect local companies and hospitals, directly affecting innocent people, encrypting their files using the extension \u00e2\u20ac\u0153.___xratteamLucked\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and asking to pay the ransom.\r\n\r\nThe Kaspersky Anti-Ransom team decrypted the Xpan Trojan, allowing them to rescue the files of a Hospital in Brazil that had fallen victim to this Ransomware family.\r\n\r\nActually, this is not the first ransomware to come out of Brazil. In the past, we investigated TorLocker and its flawed encryption, which was created and negotiated worldwide by a Brazilian cybercriminal. We also saw a lot of copycats use HiddenTear in local attacks. Trojan Ransom Xpan was created by an organized gang, which used targeted attacks via RDP that abused weak passwords and wrong implementations.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll explain this new Ransomware family and how Brazilian coders are creating new ransomware from scratch.", "uuid": "580dac22-98c0-478c-ae59-4118950d210f", "timestamp": "1477291042", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "", "category": "External analysis", "type": "comment"}, {"to_ids": false, "deleted": false, "value": ".___xratteamLucked", "uuid": "580dac3e-98f0-4f78-a6a9-4f5d950d210f", "timestamp": "1477291070", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "", "category": "Artifacts dropped", "type": "pattern-in-memory"}, {"to_ids": true, "deleted": false, "value": "34260178f9e3b2e769accdee56dac793", "uuid": "580dac7f-93d8-46f4-bbcb-4371950d210f", "timestamp": "1477291135", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "", "category": "Payload delivery", "type": "md5"}, {"to_ids": true, "deleted": false, "value": "corporacaoxrat@mail2tor.com", "uuid": "580dace7-1508-4f27-8e8a-4dc9950d210f", "timestamp": "1477291239", "disable_correlation": false, "comment": "The ransom texts used by the group are written in Portuguese from Brazil.
