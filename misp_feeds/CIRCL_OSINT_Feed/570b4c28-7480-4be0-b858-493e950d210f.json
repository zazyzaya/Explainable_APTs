Locky is also delivered via popular Exploit Kits such as Nuclear and Neutrino.\r\n\r\nLocky has widespread reach, having been used to attack victims in over 100 countries. During its first days of activity, it managed to deploy 100,000 infection attempts per day. Just recently, the ransomware was used in an attack on a Kentucky hospital, which caused them to declare an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Internal State of Emergency.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\r\n\r\nThe ThreatSTOP Research Team has been monitoring new Indicators of Compromise for this ransomware since its debut, and has analyzed hundreds of relevant indicators.
